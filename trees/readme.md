## Medium Difficulty Tree Problems

### 1. Lowest Common Ancestor of Binary Tree

Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: "The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself)."

**Example:**
```
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.
```

### 2. Binary Tree Zigzag Level Order Traversal

Given the root of a binary tree, return the zigzag level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, then right to left for the next level and alternate between).

**Example:**
```
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: [[3],[20,9],[15,7]]
Explanation:
Level 0: [3]
Level 1: [20,9] (right to left)
Level 2: [15,7] (left to right)
```

### 3. Boundary Traversal of Binary Tree

Given a binary tree, return the values of its boundary in anti-clockwise direction starting from root. Boundary includes left boundary, leaves, and right boundary in order.

Left boundary is defined as the path from root to the left-most node. Right boundary is defined as the path from root to the right-most node. If the root doesn't have left subtree or right subtree, then the root itself is left boundary or right boundary.

**Example:**
```
Input:
        1
      /   \
     2     3
    / \   / \
   4   5 6   7
      / \
     8   9

Output: [1,2,4,8,9,6,7,3]
```

### 4. Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal

Given preorder and inorder traversal of a tree, construct the binary tree.

Note: You may assume that duplicates do not exist in the tree.

**Example:**
```
Preorder: [3,9,20,15,7]
Inorder: [9,3,15,20,7]

Output tree:
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
```

### 5. Maximum Width of Binary Tree

Given a binary tree, write a function to get the maximum width of the given tree. The maximum width of a tree is the maximum width among all levels.

The width of one level is defined as the length between the end-nodes (the leftmost and rightmost non-null nodes), where the null nodes between the end-nodes are also counted into the length calculation.

**Example:**
```
Input: 
           1
         /   \
        3     2
       / \     \  
      5   3     9 

Output: 4
Explanation: The maximum width exists in the third level with length 4 (5,3,null,9).
```

### 6. Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree

Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

**Example:**
```
Input: root = [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]
Output: [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]
```

### 7. Path Sum III

Given the root of a binary tree and an integer targetSum, return the number of paths where the sum of the values along the path equals targetSum.

The path does not need to start or end at the root or a leaf, but it must go downwards (i.e., traveling only from parent nodes to child nodes).

**Example:**
```
Input: root = [10,5,-3,3,2,null,11,3,-2,null,1], targetSum = 8
Output: 3
Explanation: The paths that sum to 8 are shown.
```

### 8. Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List

Given the root of a binary tree, flatten the tree into a "linked list":

- The "linked list" should use the same TreeNode class where the right child pointer points to the next node in the list and the left child pointer is always null.
- The "linked list" should be in the same order as a pre-order traversal of the binary tree.

**Example:**
```
Input: root = [1,2,5,3,4,null,6]
Output: [1,null,2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6]
```
